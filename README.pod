=head1 DBD::MariaDB - database driver for Perl

=for html <a href="https://travis-ci.org/gooddata/DBD-MariaDB"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/gooddata/DBD-MariaDB.svg?branch=master"></a>

This is the Perl L<DBI> driver for access to MariaDB and MySQL databases.

The goal of our effort was to fix MariaDB compatibility, Perl Unicode support
and security related bugs.

This Perl DBI driver is a fork of the L<DBD::mysql> driver and was created
because said issues in the original DBD::mysql have not been addressed for more
than a year.
